# Functions and intro to recursion
* Functions allow you to modularize your program by separating its tasks into subtasks.
* in any language like cpp there are a lot of predefined functions.
## motivation to modularize the program with functions:
* software reuse for example in your program if you want to read a line of text from the user c++ provide a function called getline() and more.
*  prevent code repetitiom
*  also to follow the solid principle,as there is a principle called single responsibility principle that states that a module should be responsible to one, and only one, job or resposible.
